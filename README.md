Hierarchical Generalized Dirichlet Prior for Sparse Multinomial Distributions


ALGORITHMS FILES
===========================================================
- Hierarchical_GD.py

*the python code that contains the implementation of the generalized sparse multinomial
The splitting of training/testing set is randomly affected that's why we run and average over 10 times the algorihtm 
Each run gives a slight different results.

- sparse_multinomial.py

*the python code that contains the related-works of [Friedman and Singer1999, Ristad1998] and [Griffiths and Tenenbaum2001]
