poem	emotion1	emotion2
since feeling is first	Sadness	Sadness
who pays any attention	Sadness	Sadness
to the syntax of things	Sadness	Sadness
will never wholly kiss you;	Sadness	Sadness
wholly to be a fool	Sadness	Sadness
while Spring is in the world	Sadness	Sadness
my blood approves	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
and kisses are a better fate	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
than wisdom	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
lady i swear by all flowers. Don"t cry	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
—the best gesture of my brain is less than	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
your eyelids" flutter which says	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
we are for each other: then	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
laugh, leaning back in my arms	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
for life"s not a paragraph	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
and death i think is no parenthesis	Sadness	Awe / Sublime
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
For the ends of being and ideal grace.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I love thee to the level of every day"s	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I love thee with the passion put to use	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In my old griefs, and with my childhood"s faith.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I shall but love thee better after death.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
If ever any beauty I did see,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And now good-morrow to our waking souls,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Which watch not one another out of fear;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
For love, all love of other sights controls,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And makes one little room an everywhere.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,	Vitality	Vitality
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,	Vitality	Vitality
Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.	Vitality	Vitality
My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Where can we find two better hemispheres,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Without sharp north, without declining west?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
If our two loves be one, or, thou and I	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Happy the man, and happy he alone,	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
He who can call today his own:	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
He who, secure within, can say,	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
Be fair or foul or rain or shine	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Of Manners gentle , of Affections mild ;	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
In Wit , a Man ; Simplicity , a Child :	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
With native Humour temp"ring virtuous Rage ,	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
Form "d to delight at once and lash the age :	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
Above Temptation , in a low Estate ,	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
And uncorrupted , ev"n among the Great :	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
A safe Companion , and an easy Friend ,	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
Unblam "d thro ’ Life , lamented in thy End .	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
These are Thy Honours ! not that here thy Bust	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
Is mix "d with Heroes , or with Kings thy dust ;	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
But that the Worthy and the Good shall say ,	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
Striking their pensive bosoms — Here lies GAY .	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
Music , when soft voices die ,	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Vibrates in the memory —	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Odours , when sweet violets sicken ,	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Live within the sense they quicken .	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Rose leaves , when the rose is dead ,	Sadness	Sadness
Are heaped for the beloved "s bed ;	Sadness	Sadness
And so thy thoughts , when thou art gone ,	Sadness	Sadness
Love itself shall slumber on .	Sadness	Sadness
The sun is warm , the sky is clear ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The waves are dancing fast and bright ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Blue isles and snowy mountains wear	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The purple noon "s transparent might ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The breath of the moist earth is light ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Around its unexpanded buds ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Like many a voice of one delight ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The winds , the birds , the ocean floods ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The City "s voice itself , is soft like Solitude "s .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I see the Deep "s untrampled floor	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
With green and purple seaweeds strown ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I see the waves upon the shore ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Like light dissolved in star-showers , thrown :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I sit upon the sands alone ,—	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The lightning of the noontide ocean	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Is flashing round me , and a tone	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Arises from its measured motion ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
How sweet ! did any heart now share in my emotion .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Alas ! I have nor hope nor health ,	Sadness	Sadness
Nor peace within nor calm around ,	Sadness	Sadness
Nor that content surpassing wealth	Sadness	Sadness
The sage in meditation found ,	Sadness	Sadness
And walked with inward glory crowned —	Sadness	Sadness
Nor fame , nor power , nor love , nor leisure .	Sadness	Sadness
Others I see whom these surround —	Sadness	Sadness
Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;—	Sadness	Sadness
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure .	Sadness	Sadness
Yet now despair itself is mild ,	Sadness	Sadness
Even as the winds and waters are ;	Sadness	Sadness
I could lie down like a tired child ,	Sadness	Sadness
And weep away the life of care	Sadness	Sadness
Which I have borne and yet must bear ,	Sadness	Sadness
Till death like sleep might steal on me ,	Sadness	Sadness
And I might feel in the warm air	Sadness	Sadness
My cheek grow cold , and hear the sea	Sadness	Sadness
Breathe o"er my dying brain its last monotony .	Sadness	Sadness
Some might lament that I were cold ,	Sadness	Sadness
As I , when this sweet day is gone ,	Sadness	Sadness
Which my lost heart , too soon grown old ,	Sadness	Sadness
Insults with this untimely moan ;	Sadness	Sadness
They might lament — for I am one	Sadness	Sadness
Whom men love not ,— and yet regret ,	Sadness	Sadness
Unlike this day , which , when the sun	Sadness	Sadness
Shall on its stainless glory set ,	Sadness	Sadness
Will linger , though enjoyed , like joy in memory yet .	Sadness	Sadness
Break , break , break ,	Vitality	Vitality
On thy cold gray stones , O Sea !	Vitality	Vitality
And I would that my tongue could utter	Vitality	Vitality
The thoughts that arise in me .	Vitality	Vitality
O well for the fisherman "s boy ,	Vitality	Vitality
That he shouts with his sister at play !	Vitality	Vitality
O well for the sailor lad ,	Vitality	Vitality
That he sings in his boat on the bay !	Vitality	Vitality
And the stately ships go on	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
To their haven under the hill ;	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
But O for the touch of a vanish "d hand ,	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
And the sound of a voice that is still !	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
Break , break , break ,	Vitality	Vitality
At the foot of thy crags , O Sea !	Vitality	Vitality
But the tender grace of a day that is dead	Vitality	Vitality
Will never come back to me .	Vitality	Vitality
TAKE up the White Man"s burden -	Uneasiness	Vitality
Send forth the best ye breed -	Uneasiness	Vitality
Go bind your sons to exile	Uneasiness	Vitality
To serve your captives" need;	Uneasiness	Vitality
To wait in heavy harness	Uneasiness	Vitality
On fluttered folk and wild -	Uneasiness	Vitality
Your new-caught sullen peoples,	Uneasiness	Vitality
Half devil and half child.	Uneasiness	Vitality
Take up the White Man"s burden -	Uneasiness	Vitality
In patience to abide	Uneasiness	Vitality
To veil the threat of terror	Uneasiness	Vitality
And check the show of pride;	Uneasiness	Vitality
By open speech and simple,	Uneasiness	Vitality
An hundred times made plain,	Uneasiness	Vitality
To seek another"s profit,	Uneasiness	Vitality
And work another"s gain.	Uneasiness	Vitality
Take up the White Man"s burden -	Uneasiness	Vitality
The savage wars of peace -	Uneasiness	Vitality
Fill full the mouth of famine	Uneasiness	Vitality
And bid the sickness cease;	Uneasiness	Vitality
And when your goal is nearest	Uneasiness	Vitality
The end for others sought,	Uneasiness	Vitality
Watch Sloth and heathen Folly	Uneasiness	Vitality
Bring all your hopes to nought.	Uneasiness	Vitality
Take up the White Man"s burden -	Uneasiness	Vitality
No tawdry rule of kings,	Uneasiness	Vitality
But toil of serf and sweeper -	Uneasiness	Vitality
The tale of common things.	Uneasiness	Vitality
The ports ye shall not enter,	Uneasiness	Vitality
The roads ye shall not tread,	Uneasiness	Vitality
Go make them with your living,	Uneasiness	Vitality
And mark them with your dead !	Uneasiness	Vitality
Take up the White Man"s burden -	Uneasiness	Vitality
And reap his old reward,	Uneasiness	Vitality
The blame of those ye better,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The hate of those ye guard -	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The cry of hosts ye humour	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
(Ah slowly !) towards the light:-	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
"Why brought ye us from bondage,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
"Our loved Egyptian night ?"	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Take up the White Man"s burden -	Sadness	Uneasiness
Ye dare not stoop to less -	Sadness	Uneasiness
Nor call too loud on Freedom	Sadness	Uneasiness
To cloak your weariness;	Sadness	Uneasiness
By all ye cry or whisper,	Sadness	Uneasiness
By all ye leave or do,	Sadness	Uneasiness
The silent sullen peoples	Sadness	Uneasiness
Shall weigh your Gods and you.	Sadness	Uneasiness
Take up the White Man"s burden -	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Have done with childish days -	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The lightly proffered laurel,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The easy, ungrudged praise.	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Comes now, to search your manhood	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Through all the thankless years,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The judgement of your peers.	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
They shut the road through the woods	Sadness	Suspense
Seventy years ago.	Sadness	Suspense
Weather and rain have undone it again,	Sadness	Sadness
And now you would never know	Sadness	Sadness
There was once a road through the woods	Sadness	Sadness
Before they planted the trees.	Sadness	Sadness
It is underneath the coppice and heath,	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
And the thin anemones.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Only the keeper sees	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
That, where the ring-dove broods,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
And the badgers roll at ease,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
There was once a road through the woods.	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
Yet, if you enter the woods	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Of a summer evening late,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Where the otter whistles his mate,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
(They fear not men in the woods,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Because they see so few.)	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
Steadily cantering through	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
The misty solitudes,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
As though they perfectly knew	Sadness	Sadness
The old lost road through the woods.	Sadness	Sadness
But there is no road through the woods.	Sadness	Sadness
O rose , thou art sick !	Sadness	Uneasiness
The invisible worm ,	Sadness	Uneasiness
That flies in the night ,	Sadness	Uneasiness
In the howling storm ,	Sadness	Uneasiness
Has found out thy bed	Sadness	Uneasiness
And his dark secret love	Sadness	Uneasiness
Does thy life destroy.	Sadness	Uneasiness
I was angry with my friend :	Annoyance	Annoyance
I told my wrath , my wrath did end .	Annoyance	Annoyance
I was angry with my foe :	Annoyance	Annoyance
I told it not , my wrath did grow .	Annoyance	Annoyance
And I watered it in fears	Annoyance	Annoyance
Night and morning with my tears ,	Annoyance	Annoyance
And I sunned it with smiles	Annoyance	Annoyance
And with soft deceitful wiles .	Annoyance	Annoyance
Earth has not anything to show more fair:	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
A sight so touching in its majesty:	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
This City now doth, like a garment, wear	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Never did sun more beautifully steep	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
The river glideth at his own sweet will:	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
And all that mighty heart is lying still!	Beauty / Joy	Awe / Sublime
My heart leaps up when I behold	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
A rainbow in the sky:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
So was it when my life began;	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
So is it now I am a man;	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia
So be it when I shall grow old,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Or let me die!	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
The Child is father of the Man;	Vitality	Vitality
And I could wish my days to be	Vitality	Vitality
Bound each to each by natural piety.	Vitality	Vitality
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;	Sadness	Sadness
That only men incredulous of despair,	Sadness	Sadness
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air	Sadness	Sadness
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access	Sadness	Sadness
Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,	Sadness	Sadness
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare	Sadness	Sadness
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare	Sadness	Sadness
Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express	Sadness	Sadness
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—	Sadness	Sadness
Most like a monumental statue set	Sadness	Sadness
In everlasting watch and moveless woe	Sadness	Sadness
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.	Sadness	Sadness
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:	Sadness	Sadness
If it could weep, it could arise and go.	Sadness	Sadness
Let the world "s sharpness , like a clasping knife ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Shut in upon itself and do no harm	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In this close hand of Love , now soft and warm ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And let us hear no sound of human strife	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
After the click of the shutting . Life to life —	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I lean upon thee , Dear , without alarm ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Against the stab of worldlings , who if rife	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Are weak to injure . Very-whitely still	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The lilies of our lives may reassure	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Their blossoms from their roots , accessible	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Growing straight , out of man "s reach , on the hill .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
God only , who made us rich , can make us poor .	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
AH, how sweet it is to love!	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
Ah, how gay is young Desire!	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
And what pleasing pains we prove	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
When we first approach Love"s fire!	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
Pains of love be sweeter far	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
Than all other pleasures are.	Vitality	Beauty / Joy
Sighs which are from lovers blown	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Do but gently heave the heart:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Ev"n the tears they shed alone	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Cure, like trickling balm, their smart:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Lovers, when they lose their breath,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Bleed away in easy death.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Love and Time with reverence use,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Treat them like a parting friend;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Nor the golden gifts refuse	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Which in youth sincere they send:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
For each year their price is more,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And they less simple than before.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Love, like spring-tides full and high,	Sadness	Sadness
Swells in every youthful vein;	Sadness	Sadness
But each tide does less supply,	Sadness	Sadness
Till they quite shrink in again:	Sadness	Sadness
If a flow in age appear,	Sadness	Sadness
"Tis but rain, and runs not clear.	Sadness	Sadness
FROM harmony , from heavenly harmony	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
This universal frame began :	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
When nature underneath a heap	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
Of jarring atoms lay ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
And could not heave her head ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
The tuneful voice was heard from high ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
Arise , ye more than dead .	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
Then cold , and hot , and moist , and dry ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
In order to their stations leap ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
And Music "s power obey .	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
From harmony , from heavenly harmony	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
This universal frame began :	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
From harmony to harmony	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
Through all the compass of the notes it rail ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
The diapason closing full in Man .	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
What passion cannot Music raise and quell ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
When Jubal struck the chorded shell ,	Suspense	Beauty / Joy
His listening brethren stood around ,	Suspense	Beauty / Joy
And , wondering , on their faces fell	Suspense	Beauty / Joy
To worship that celestial sound .	Suspense	Beauty / Joy
Less than a God they thought there could not dwell	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Within the hollow of that shell ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
That spoke so sweetly and so well .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
What passion cannot Music raise and quell ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The trumpet "s loud clangour	Vitality	Uneasiness
Excites us to arms ,	Vitality	Vitality
With shrill notes of anger ,	Vitality	Vitality
And mortal alarms .	Vitality	Vitality
The double double double beat	Vitality	Vitality
Of the thundering drum	Vitality	Vitality
Cries , hark ! the foes come ;	Vitality	Vitality
Charge , charge ! " tis too late to retreat .	Vitality	Vitality
The soft complaining flute	Sadness	Sadness
In dying notes discovers	Sadness	Sadness
The woes of hopeless lovers ,	Sadness	Sadness
Whose dirge is whisper "d by the warbling lute .	Sadness	Sadness
Sharp violins proclaim	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Their jealous pangs , and desperation ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Fury , frantic indignation ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Depth of pains , and height of passion ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
For the fair , disdainful dame .	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
But oh ! what art can teach ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
What human voice can reach ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The sacred organ "s praise ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Notes inspiring holy love ,	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
Notes that wing their heavenly ways	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
To mend the choirs above .	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy
Orpheus could lead the savage race ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And trees uprooted left their place ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Sequacious of the lyre :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
But bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
When to her organ vocal breath was given ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
An angel heard , and straight appear "d ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Mistaking earth for heaven .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The flower that smiles to-day	Sadness	Sadness
To-morrow dies ;	Sadness	Sadness
All that we wish to stay	Sadness	Sadness
Tempts and then flies .	Sadness	Sadness
What is this world "s delight ?	Sadness	Awe / Sublime
Lightning that mocks the night ,	Sadness	Awe / Sublime
Brief even as bright .	Sadness	Awe / Sublime
Virtue , how frail it is !	Sadness	Sadness
Friendship how rare !	Sadness	Sadness
Love , how it sells poor bliss	Sadness	Sadness
For proud despair !	Sadness	Sadness
But we , though soon they fall ,	Sadness	Sadness
Survive their joy , and all	Sadness	Sadness
Which ours we call .	Sadness	Sadness
Whilst skies are blue and bright ,	Vitality	Vitality
Whilst flowers are gay ,	Vitality	Vitality
Whilst eyes that change ere night	Vitality	Vitality
Make glad the day ;	Vitality	Vitality
Whilst yet the calm hours creep ,	Sadness	Vitality
Dream thou — and from thy sleep	Sadness	Vitality
Then wake to weep .	Sadness	Vitality

The expense of spirit in a waste of shame	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Is lust in action : and till action , lust	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Is perjur "d , murderous , bloody , full of blame ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Enjoy "d no sooner but despised straight ;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Past reason hated , as a swallow "d bait ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
On purpose laid to make the taker mad :	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;	Sadness	Uneasiness
Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ;	Sadness	Sadness
A bliss in proof ,— and prov "d , a very woe ;	Sadness	Sadness
Before , a joy propos "d ; behind a dream .	Sadness	Sadness
All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well	Sadness	Sadness
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .	Sadness	Sadness
When my love swears that she is made of truth ,	Sadness	Sadness
I do believe her , though I know she lies ,	Sadness	Sadness
That she might think me some untutor "d youth ,	Sadness	Sadness
Unskilful in the world "s false forgeries ,	Sadness	Sadness
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,	Sadness	Sadness
Although I know my years be past the best ,	Sadness	Sadness
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue ,	Sadness	Sadness
Outfacing faults in love with love "s ill rest .	Sadness	Sadness
But wherefore says my love that she is young ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And wherefore say not I that I am old ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
O , love "s best habit is a soothing tongue ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And age , in love , loves not to have years told .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Therefore , I "ll lie with love , and love with me ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Since that our faults in love thus smother "d be .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Sunset and evening star,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And one clear call for me!	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And may there be no moaning of the bar,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
When I put out to sea,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Too full for sound and foam,	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
When that which drew from out the boundless deep	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Turns again home.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Twilight and evening bell,	Sadness	Vitality
And after that the dark!	Sadness	Vitality
And may there be no sadness of farewell,	Sadness	Vitality
When I embark;	Sadness	Vitality
For tho’ from out our bourne of Time and Place	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
The flood may bear me far,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
I hope to see my Pilot face to face	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
When I have crost the bar.	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Tyger , tyger , burning bright	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In the forests of the night ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
What immortal hand or eye	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Could frame thy fearful symmetry ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In what distant deeps or skies	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Burnt the fire of thine eyes ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
On what wings dare he aspire ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
What the hand dare seize the fire ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And what shoulder and what art	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Could twist the sinews of thy heart ?	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And , when thy heart began to beat ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
What dread hand and what dread feet ?	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
What the hammer ? what the chain ?	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
In what furnace was thy brain ?	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
What the anvil ? what dread grasp	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Dare its deadly terrors clasp ?	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
When the stars threw down their spears ,	Awe / Sublime	Awe / Sublime
And watered heaven with their tears ,	Awe / Sublime	Awe / Sublime
Did he smile his work to see ?	Awe / Sublime	Awe / Sublime
Did he who made the lamb make thee ?	Awe / Sublime	Awe / Sublime
Tyger , tyger , burning bright	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In the forests of the night ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
What immortal hand or eye	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
A sudden blow: the great wings beating still	Suspense	Suspense
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed	Uneasiness	Suspense
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,	Uneasiness	Suspense
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.	Uneasiness	Suspense
How can those terrified vague fingers push	Uneasiness	Suspense
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?	Uneasiness	Suspense
And how can body, laid in that white rush,	Uneasiness	Suspense

They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And along the trampled edges of the street	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Sprouting despondently at area gates .	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The brown waves of fog toss up to me	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
An aimless smile that hovers in the air	Sadness	Uneasiness
And vanishes along the level of the roofs .	Sadness	Uneasiness
The winter evening settles down	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
With smell of steaks in passageways .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Six o"clock .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The burnt-out ends of smoky days .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

And newspapers from vacant lots ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The showers beat	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
On broken blinds and chimney-pots ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And at the corner of the street	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps .	Sadness	Beauty / Joy
And then the lighting of the lamps .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The morning comes to consciousness	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Of faint stale smells of beer	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
From the sawdust-trampled street	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
With all its muddy feet that press	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
To early coffee-stands .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
With the other masquerades	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
That time resumes ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
One thinks of all the hands	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
That are raising dingy shades	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In a thousand furnished rooms .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
You tossed a blanket from the bed ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
You lay upon your back , and waited ;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
You dozed , and watched the night revealing	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The thousand sordid images	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Of which your soul was constituted ;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
They flickered against the ceiling .	Sadness	Uneasiness
And when all the world came back	Sadness	Uneasiness
And the light crept up between the shutters ,	Sadness	Uneasiness
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters ,	Sadness	Uneasiness
You had such a vision of the street	Sadness	Uneasiness
As the street hardly understands ;	Sadness	Uneasiness
Sitting along the bed "s edge , where	Sadness	Sadness
You curled the papers from your hair ,	Sadness	Sadness
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet	Uneasiness	Sadness
In the palms of both soiled hands .	Uneasiness	Sadness
His soul stretched tight across the skies	Vitality	Vitality
That fade behind a city block ,	Vitality	Vitality
Or trampled by insistent feet	Vitality	Vitality
At four and five and six o"clock	Vitality	Vitality
And short square fingers stuffing pipes ,	Vitality	Vitality
And evening newspapers , and eyes	Vitality	Vitality
Assured of certain certainties ,	Vitality	Vitality
The conscience of a blackened street	Vitality	Vitality
Impatient to assume the world .	Vitality	Vitality
I am moved by fancies that are curled	Vitality	Vitality
Around these images , and cling :	Vitality	Vitality
The notion of some infinitely gentle	Awe / Sublime	Vitality
Infinitely suffering thing .	Awe / Sublime	Vitality
Wipe your hand across your mouth , and laugh ;	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
The worlds revolve like ancient women	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Gathering fuel in vacant lots .	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Nor dread nor hope attend	Sadness	Sadness
A dying animal;	Sadness	Sadness
A man awaits his end	Sadness	Sadness
Dreading and hoping all;	Sadness	Sadness
Many times he died,	Sadness	Sadness
Many times rose again,	Sadness	Sadness
A great man in his pride	Uneasiness	Sadness
Confronting murderous men	Uneasiness	Sadness
Casts derision upon	Uneasiness	Sadness
Supersession of breath;	Uneasiness	Sadness
He knows death to the bone –	Uneasiness	Sadness
Man has created death.	Uneasiness	Sadness
Turning and turning in the widening gyre	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The best lack all conviction, while the worst	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Are full of passionate intensity.	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Surely some revelation is at hand;	Suspense	Suspense
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.	Suspense	Suspense
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out	Suspense	Suspense
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi	Suspense	Suspense
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert	Suspense	Suspense
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,	Suspense	Suspense
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,	Suspense	Suspense
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it	Suspense	Suspense
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.	Suspense	Suspense
The darkness drops again; but now I know	Suspense	Uneasiness
That twenty centuries of stony sleep	Suspense	Uneasiness
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,	Suspense	Uneasiness
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,	Suspense	Uneasiness
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?	Suspense	Uneasiness
Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth	Annoyance	Annoyance

Methinks I the Advent"rous Merchant see ,	Sadness	Sadness
Ploughing the faithless Seas , in search of thee ,	Sadness	Sadness
His dearest Wife and Children left behind ,	Sadness	Sadness
( His real Wealth ) while he , a Slave to th ’ Wind ,	Sadness	Sadness
Sometimes becalm "d , the Shore with longing Eyes	Sadness	Sadness
Wishes to see , and what he wishes , Spies :	Sadness	Sadness
For a rude Tempest wakes him from his Dream ,	Sadness	Sadness
And Strands his Bark by a more sad Extream .	Sadness	Sadness
Thus , hopless Wretch , is his whole Life-time spent ,	Sadness	Sadness
And though thrice Wreck"t , ‘ s no Wiser than he went .	Sadness	Sadness
Again , I see , the Heavenly Fair despis "d ,	Annoyance	Sadness
A Hagg like Hell , with Gold , more highly priz "d ;	Annoyance	Sadness
Mens Faith betray "d , their Prince and Country Sold ,	Annoyance	Sadness
Their God deny "d , all for the Idol Gold .	Annoyance	Sadness
Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar ,	Annoyance	Uneasiness
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ?	Annoyance	Uneasiness
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray ,	Annoyance	Uneasiness
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ?	Annoyance	Uneasiness
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find ,	Annoyance	Uneasiness
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind .	Annoyance	Uneasiness

The Herds , the Groves , the gentle purling Streams ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Adorn "d his Song , and were his highest Theams .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

Biding him more Illustrious Subjects choose ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The Acts of Gods , and God-like Men reherse .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

On whose forbidden ear	Sadness	Sadness
The distant strains of triumph	Sadness	Sadness
Break , agonized and clear !	Sadness	Sadness
I felt a funeral in my brain ,	Sadness	Sadness
And mourners , to and fro ,	Sadness	Sadness
Kept treading , treading , till it seemed	Sadness	Sadness
That sense was breaking through .	Sadness	Sadness
And when they all were seated ,	Sadness	Sadness
A service like a drum	Sadness	Sadness
Kept beating , beating , till I thought	Sadness	Sadness
My mind was going numb .	Sadness	Sadness
And then I heard them lift a box ,	Sadness	Sadness
And creak across my soul	Sadness	Sadness
With those same boots of lead , again .	Sadness	Sadness
Then space began to toll	Sadness	Sadness
As all the heavens were a bell ,	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
And Being but an ear ,	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
And I and silence some strange race ,	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
Wrecked , solitary , here .	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
And then a Plank in Reason, broke,	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
And I dropped down, and down -	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
And hit a World, at every plunge,	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
And Finished knowing - then -	Awe / Sublime	Sadness
WHEN I consider how my light is spent	Suspense	Sadness
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,	Suspense	Sadness
And that one Talent which is death to hide	Sadness	Sadness
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent	Sadness	Sadness
To serve therewith my Maker, and present	Vitality	Vitality
My true account, lest He returning chide,	Vitality	Vitality
“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”	Vitality	Vitality
I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent	Vitality	Vitality
That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need	Awe / Sublime	Sadness

HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,	Sadness	Sadness
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!	Sadness	Sadness
My hasting days fly on with full career,	Vitality	Vitality
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.	Vitality	Vitality
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,	Vitality	Vitality
That I to manhood am arrived so near,	Vitality	Vitality
And inward ripeness doth much less appear,	Vitality	Vitality
That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th.	Vitality	Vitality
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,	Vitality	Vitality
It shall be still in strictest measure even	Vitality	Vitality

All is, if I have grace to use it so,	Vitality	Vitality
As ever in my great Task-master’s eye	Vitality	Vitality
THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one ,	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground .	Beauty / Joy	Suspense
What was it it whispered ? I knew not well myself ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Something , perhaps , about the lack of sound —	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And that was why it whispered and did not speak .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
( Pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

You’ve fallen cold and dead.	Sadness	Sadness
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,	Sadness	Sadness
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,	Sadness	Sadness

Nothing beside remains . Round the decay	Sadness	Nostalgia

Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In a field I looked into going past,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
But a few weeds and stubble showing last.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The woods around it have it--it is theirs.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
All animals are smothered in their lairs.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
I am too absent-spirited to count;	Sadness	Sadness
The loneliness includes me unawares.	Sadness	Sadness
And lonely as it is that loneliness	Sadness	Sadness
Will be more lonely ere it will be less--	Sadness	Sadness
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow	Sadness	Sadness
With no expression, nothing to express.	Sadness	Sadness
They cannot scare me with their empty spaces	Sadness	Sadness
Between stars--on stars where no human race is.	Sadness	Sadness
I have it in me so much nearer home	Sadness	Sadness
To scare myself with my own desert places.	Sadness	Sadness

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And treat those two impostors just the same;	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
If you can make one heap of all your winnings	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
And lose, and start again at your beginnings	Beauty / Joy	Vitality

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew	Beauty / Joy	Vitality

A noiseless patient spider ,	Vitality	Sadness
I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated ,	Vitality	Sadness
Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding ,	Vitality	Sadness
It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself ,	Vitality	Sadness
Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .	Vitality	Sadness
And you O my soul where you stand ,	Sadness	Sadness
Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space ,	Sadness	Sadness
Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to	Sadness	Sadness
connect them ,	Sadness	Sadness
Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold ,	Sadness	adness
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .	Sadness	Sadness
I wandered through each chartered street ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
Near where the chartered Thames does flow ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
A mark in every face I meet ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
Marks of weakness , marks of woe .	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
In every cry of every man ,	Sadness	Sadness
In every infant "s cry of fear ,	Sadness	Sadness
In every voice , in every ban ,	Sadness	Sadness
The mind-forged manacles I hear :	Sadness	Sadness
How the chimney-sweeper "s cry	Sadness	Sadness
Every blackening church appalls ,	Sadness	Sadness
And the hapless soldier "s sigh	Annoyance	Annoyance
Runs in blood down palace-walls .	Annoyance	Annoyance
But most , through midnight streets I hear	Annoyance	Annoyance
How the youthful harlot "s curse	Annoyance	Annoyance
Blasts the new-born infant "s tear ,	Annoyance	Annoyance
And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse .	Annoyance	Sadness
AT ten A.M. the young housewife	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
moves about in negligee behind	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
the wooden walls of her husband"s house.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I pass solitary in my car.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Then again she comes to the curb	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
shy, uncorseted, tucking in	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
stray ends of hair, and I compare her	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
to a fallen leaf.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
The noiseless wheels of my car	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
rush with a crackling sound over	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
I wandered lonely as a Cloud	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
That floats on high over Vales and Hills ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
When all at once I saw a crowd	Nostalgia 	Nostalgia
A host of dancing Daffodills ;	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
Along the Lake , beneath the trees ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
Ten thousand dancing in the breeze .	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
Continuous as the stars that shine	Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy
And twinkle on the milky way,	Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy
They stretched in never-ending line	Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy
Along the margin of a bay:	Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,	Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.	Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy
The waves beside them danced , but they	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Outdid the sparkling waves in glee :—	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
A Poet could not but be gay	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In such a laughing company :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I gazed — and gazed — but little thought	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
What wealth the shew to me had brought :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
For oft when on my couch I lie	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
In vacant or in pensive mood ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
They flash upon that inward eye	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
Which is the bliss of solitude ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
And dances with the Daffodils .	Nostalgia	Nostalgia
